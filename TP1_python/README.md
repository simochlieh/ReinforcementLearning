# README
The root folder is composed of 2 elements: `TP1_python/   requirements.txt`.
In order to run the code, please install the requirements in `requirements.txt` by doing in the root folder:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run jupyter notebook script from `TP1_python/`:
```
cd TP1_python/
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the jupyter web app and you can go on the TP1_RL notebook to look at the report and code. 

## Organisation of the code
The code is written in different files `TP1_python/ex1.py` and `TP1_python/ex2.py` for every exercise. 
The exercise 1 file contains the class implmenting the `MDPModel`. 
The exercise 2 file contains bunch of methods used to run the different reinforcement 
learning algorithms.
